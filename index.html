    <h1>Data Protection Act (2018)</h1>
    <p><dfn>An Act to make provision for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals; to make provision in connection with the Information Commissioner’s functions under certain regulations relating to information; to make provision for a direct marketing code of practice; and for connected purposes.</dfn></p>

    <h2>Data Protection Principles</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="Data Protection Act (2018)">DPA</abbr> outlines strict rules called 'data protection principles' which all organisations responsible for handling personal data have to follow. They must make sure the user's information is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>used fairly, lawfully, and clearly</li>
        <li>used for explicitly specified purposes</li>
        <li>used in a way that is relevant and necessary</li>
        <li>accurate and kept up to date (where required)</li>
        <li>kept for no longer than necessary</li>
        <li>handled in a way that ensures adequate security (this includes protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction, or damage)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Covered by the Act:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Biometrics (where used for identification)</li>
        <li>Ethnic background</li>
        <li>Genetics</li>
        <li>Health</li>
        <li>Political opinions</li>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Religious beliefs</li>
        <li>Sex life or sexual orientation</li>
        <li>Trade union membership</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rights</h2>
    <p>Users have the right to find out about and alter their personal information being stored by organisations, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knowing about the method of data storage</li>
        <li>Accessing personal data</li>
        <li>Having incorrect data updated</li>
        <li>Having data erased</li>
        <li>Preventing or restricting the processing of their data</li>
        <li>Getting and reusing their data for different sevices (data portability)</li>
        <li>Objecting to how their data is processed (in certain cicumstances)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These rights extend to when an organisation is using users' data for automated decision-making processes or profiling (e.g. predicting a user's behaviour/interests).</p>

    <h3>Requesting Data</h3>
    <p>Users have the right to write to an organisation to ask for a copy of the personal information they hold about them (free of charge unless the user asks for a large amount or information or the request takes a lot of time and effort to process). If the organisation is public, they should write to their <abbr title="Data Protection Officer">DPO</abbr>; if it's private, or it's unclear who they should write to, address your letter to the company secretary.</p>
    <p>Users should recieve a copy of the information as soon as possible, within a month. However, in certain circumstances (e.g. complex or multiple requests), the organisation can take 2 more months to provide it. In this case, they must disclose this within 1 month of the request and tell the user why there's a delay.</p>
    <p>Information can be withheld under certain circumstances, without disclosing the reason, for example if the information is about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the prevention, detection or investigation of a crime</li>
        <li>national security or the armed forces</li>
        <li>the assessment or collection of tax</li>
        <li>judicial or ministerial appointments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Making a Complaint</h3>
    <p>Users can contact the organisation holding their data if they believe it is being misused or being held unsecurely. If they don't give a satisfactory response, users can make a complaint to or get advice from the <abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>. The ICO may investigate the user's claim and take action against the organisation who's misused their personal information.</p>

    <h2>Timeline</h2>
    <p>On the 13th September 2017, the <abbr title="Data Protection Act (2018)">DPA</abbr> was introduced to the House of Lords at the <abbr title="Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport">DCMS</abbr> by Lord Ashton to replace the 1998 Data Protection Act.</p>
    <p> On the 25th May 2018, it recieved royal assent (meaning it was formally approved by the monarch at the time).</p>
    <p>On the 1st January 2021, it was ammended by regulations under the European Union (Withdrawl) Act 2018, due to the UK's withdrawl from the EU.</p>

    <h2>Enforcement</h2>
    <p>The <abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr> has various powers to take action against a breach of the data protection principles, including the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Assessment notices</li>
        <li>Warnings</li>
        <li>Reprimands</li>
        <li>Enforcement protection principles</li>
        <li>Penalty notices (administrative fines)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>For more serious breaches of the act, the ICO can issue fines up to £17.5 million or 4% of the perpetrator's annual worldwide turnover (whichever is higher).</p>
    <p>The ICO doesn't always enforce the <abbr title="Data Protection Act (2018)">DPA</abbr>, as they state the following:</p>
    <blockquote cite="https://ico.org.uk/for-organisations/uk-gdpr-guidance-and-resources/data-sharing/data-sharing-a-code-of-practice/enforcement-of-this-code/">The ICO focuses the use of its enforcement powers on cases involving reckless or deliberate harms, and is therefore unlikely to take enforcement action against any organisation genuinely seeking to comply with the provisions of the legislation. Nor does it seek to penalise organisations where a member of staff has made a genuine mistake when acting in good faith and in the public interest; for example in an emergency situation, or to protect someone’s safety.</blockquote>
