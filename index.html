    <h1>Data Protection Act (2018)</h1>
    <p><dfn>An Act to make provision for the regulation of the processing of information relating to individuals; to make provision in connection with the Information Commissioner’s functions under certain regulations relating to information; to make provision for a direct marketing code of practice; and for connected purposes.</dfn></p>

    <h2>Data Protection Principles</h2>
    <p>The DPA outlines strict rules called 'data protection principles' which all organisations responsible for handling personal data have to follow. They must make sure the user's information is:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>used fairly, lawfully, and clearly</li>
        <li>used for explicitly specified purposes</li>
        <li>used in a way that is relevant and necessary</li>
        <li>accurate and kept up to date (where required)</li>
        <li>kept for no longer than necessary</li>
        <li>handled in a way that ensures adequate security (this includes protection against unlawful or unauthorised processing, access, loss, destruction, or damage)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Information Covered by the Act:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Biometrics (where used for identification)</li>
        <li>Ethnic background</li>
        <li>Genetics</li>
        <li>Health</li>
        <li>Political opinions</li>
        <li>Race</li>
        <li>Religious beliefs</li>
        <li>Sex life or sexual orientation</li>
        <li>Trade union membership</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Rights</h2>
    <p>Users have the right to find out about and alter their personal information being stored by organisations, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Knowing about the method of data storage</li>
        <li>Accessing personal data</li>
        <li>Having incorrect data updated</li>
        <li>Having data erased</li>
        <li>Preventing or restricting the processing of their data</li>
        <li>Getting and reusing their data for different sevices (data portability)</li>
        <li>Objecting to how their data is processed (in certain cicumstances)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These rights extend to when an organisation is using users' data for automated decision-making processes or profiling (e.g. predicting a user's behaviour/interests).</p>

    <h3>Requesting Data</h3>
    <p>Users have the right to write to an organisation to ask for a copy of the personal information they hold about them (free of charge unless the user asks for a large amount or information or the request takes a lot of time and effort to process). If the organisation is public, they should write to their <abbr title="Data Protection Officer">DPO</abbr>; if it's private, or it's unclear who they should write to, address your letter to the company secretary.</p>
    <p>Users should recieve a copy of the information as soon as possible, within a month. However, in certain circumstances (e.g. complex or multiple requests), the organisation can take 2 more months to provide it. In this case, they must disclose this within 1 month of the request and tell the user why there's a delay.</p>
    <p>Information can be withheld under certain circumstances, without disclosing the reason, for example if the information is about:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>the prevention, detection or investigation of a crime</li>
        <li>national security or the armed forces</li>
        <li>the assessment or collection of tax</li>
        <li>judicial or ministerial appointments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Making a Complaint</h3>
    <p>Users can contact the organisation holding their data if they believe it is being misused or being held unsecurely. If they don't give a satisfactory response, users can make a complaint to or get advice from the <abbr title="Information Commissioner’s Office">ICO</abbr>. The ICO may investigate the user's claim and take action against the organisation who's misused their personal information.</p>
